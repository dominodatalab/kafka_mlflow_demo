# Kafka Mlflow Demo

The basic design of this demo is as follows:

1. User runs and experiment and registers it with MLflow
2. The user registers a model in Model Registry for this experiment
3. The user deploys a Domino Model API endpoint
   a. This endpoint can serve model via a REST endpoint
   b. This endpoint also serves as a Kafka Topic listener for Features where it consumes the features and produces predictions and writes them to the prediction Kafka Topic
   c. The endpoint is also subscribed to a control Kafka Topic which will recieve model versions as they are generated by the Data Scientist
4.
